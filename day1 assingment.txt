
Q_1. what is the complexity of the following code?

	int a = 0;
	for(int i = 0; i<n; i++)
	{
	  for(int j = n; j>i; j--)
	  {
	     a = a + i + j;
	  }
	}

ANS--> complexity = O(n^2)

Q_2. what is the complexity of the following code?

	int count = 0;
	for(int i = 1; i<=n; i*2)
	{
	  for(int j = 1; j<=i; j++)
	  {
	     count count + 1;
	  }
	}

ANS--> complexity = O(nlogn)


Q_3. find the best case, average case and worst case of linear search algorithm.

ANS--> 1_Best case ==>  In the linear search problem, the best case occurs when x is present at the first location. 		                        							        so,complexity for the best case is constant.
			 
			:- complexity = O(1).

      2_Average case ==> complexity is O(n).

      3_Worst case ==>  the worst case occure when elements is present at the last location or element is not present .

			:- complexity = O(n).
